=head1 ABOUT

This archive contains the distribution Text-ASCIIPipe

It contains a module for pushing/pulling text files to/from pipes (or whatever is behind a file handle), while processing them in a line-based manner. The separation of files is achieved through usage of ASCII control characters (which thusly shall not appear in your files by themselves).

Two example scripts pack/unpack a set of files into/from a pipe. This would be a funny way to copy two files using them:

	asciipipe_in a b | asciipipe_out a.copy b.copy

Of course, the interesting part is what happens between those two example scripts.
